## Quick start

**Warning**

> Verify that you are running at least node 8.9.x and npm 5.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.

1. Go to project folder and install dependencies.
 ```bash
 npm i
 ```

2. Launch development server:
 ```bash
 npm start
 ```

**Note**

> You don't need to build the example library because it's published in npm and added as dependency of the project.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
